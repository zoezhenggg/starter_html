                <img src="images/bacon.jpg" alt="Brown labradoodle wearing colorful lei">

                <p>Bacon Q. Dog is a 9yr old labradoodle. He prefers to spend his days lounging among the three
                    different
                    beds/couches that his family has gifted him. He enjoys a walk or two around the
                    neighborhood, as
                    long as
                    he can pretend that he doesn't see any of the other animals to avoid the embarrassment of
                    not
                    wanting to
                    admit he has no wolf-like skills in chasing them.</p><br>
                <P>At night just as the rest of the family is ready to relax, Bacon suddenly wants to release
                    all of his
                    energy. He will place his toys on a mini couch and frantically drag the couch around, giving
                    his
                    toys "a
                    ride." There is also a lot of rolling. Lots and lots of rolling.</P>

                <p>Cody is a 7yr old Pembroke Corgi. He was born in Cavalier Farms, Seattle. He prefers to spend
                    his
                    days lounging on the bean bag. Every day, he enjoys two walks around the neighborhood and
                    likes to
                    make friends with other doggie friends. If lucky enough, he might see the cyclist, but he is
                    not
                    allowed to give chase.</p>
                <P>Cody loves traveling. He enjoys walking on the beach and taking sun naps. But he hates cold
                    weather.
                    He would like to stay at home lounging by the fireplace in winter.</P>

                <h1>Pluto</h1>
                <img src="images/pluto.jpg" alt="White dog looking up">

                <p>Pluto is a five year old rescue dog of an unknown breed. He was found wandering alone and
                    taken to
                    the Valley Humane Society where he found his new family. From a young age, Pluto always had
                    a
                    special personality, he was known for being very very lazy! He spends most of his time
                    staring out
                    the window to keep watch of his house. Don’t let the laziness fool you because Pluto defends
                    his
                    family from the mailman and squirrels every single day.</p>
                <P>Aside from his job as defender of the house, Pluto likes to have fun. Pluto’s favorite part
                    of the
                    day is his daily walk. Sometimes he even gets to go to the park and meet his neighbors. He
                    also
                    loves his toy duck, and only his toy duck. As a dog, it's in his nature to hunt and so he
                    makes sure
                    to get some practice with his toy duck.</P>

                <h1>Rocket</h1>
                <img src="images/rocket_primary.jpg" alt="Cute, small and yellow pomeranian">

                <p>Rocket (also named huihui) is a 6-month pomeranian puppy with big eyes and a small, black
                    cute nose.
                    Rocket is named rocket because he runs so fast and energetic all day without even having
                    some rest.
                    Rocket loves to carry his little toy walking around the house and jumping towards my bed.
                </p>
                <P>Rocket is friendly to all human beings. He will be a little shy at first, but will ‘say hi’
                    to you
                    after a few seconds. He is also friendly to dogs, especially the small breed, because the
                    large size
                    dogs are hard for him to smell lol. If you meet rocket, don’t hesitate to say hi to him!! He
                    will be
                    super happy the whole day.</P>
